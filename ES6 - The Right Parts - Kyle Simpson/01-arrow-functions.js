// Functions vs arrow functions
// Some things to keep in mind: is it easier to read the arrow function or the classical function?
// The arrow function seems simple, shorter, more intuitive at first
foo = x => 2;
// The classical function might be more readible to most users vs the arrow function
function foo() {
  return 2;
}
